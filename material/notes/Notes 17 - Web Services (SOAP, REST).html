# Notes - Web Services

Supplementary notes to complement the lecture material for web programming (F28WP).

# Why Web Services?

Software applications employ a variety of disparate formats to store and exchange data in dissimilar
ways and therefore cannot "talk" to one another productively. Web services are a practical, costeffective solution to this communication problem suffered by critical applications running over
different operating systems, platforms, and using different language that were previously
impassable. Web services are hardware, programming language, and operating system independent.
This means that applications written in different programming languages and running on different
platforms can seamlessly exchange data over intranets or the Internet using Web services.

A web service is a self-contained and self-describing web application that is available over the
Internet or an intranet and that uses open standardized messaging protocols, generally XML-based,
to exchange data directly with other web applications. Web services are designed to be accessed by
other applications. Web services have two main applications:



- To provide a fixed, embeddable and reusable data commonly needed very frequently by
  other services, which use the data to empower their own web applications. For example you
  could use small web services providing weather reports, bus timetables and news to source
  your own web application. These types of web services are also known as widgets. They
  normally implement things that are needed very often, saving the time of doing them over
  and over again.

- To connect existing web applications; by giving those applications a way to share their data
  and make them interoperable. Thus the web service of Twitter, the most popular microblogging service on the Social Web, enables other applications to use the userâ€™s tweets to
  create other services. For example, the Tums! web service allows users to inspect Twitterbased profiles and enables other web applications to re-use these profiles to create more
  additional services for example to allow users to overview their personal Twitter activities or
  to explore the topics those users were concerned with in the past. 

Therefore, the benefits of using Web Services include
(1) allowing you to expose the functionality of your existing code over the network so other
applications can use the functionality of your program;
(2) interoperability, which means allowing different applications to talk to each other and share
data and services among themselves (making the application platform and technology
independent);
(3) using open standardized protocols over HTTP for the communication and;
(4) allowing you to use your existing low cost internet for implementing Web Services.


The Web Services Vision

Support distributed applications composed of independent processes which communicate by
message passing. Targets loosely coupled systems. Enables communication between web services
implemented in different languages, and by different companies, and on different platforms


## Type of Web Services

Web services are of two kinds: Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST).

SOAP uses all the four layers (Service Transport, XML Messaging, Service Description and
Service Discovery layers) defined by the W3 protocol for Web Services. While SOAP is the
prevailing standard for complex web services, and hence has better support from other
standards such as WSDL and WS-* (extensibility) and has built-in error handling tools, it can
sometimes be slower than middleware technologies like CORBA or ICE due to its verbose
XML format. SOAP is also found to be more verbose, conceptually more difficult to
understand, more "heavy-weight" to implement. Due those reasons the use of SOAP in web
services is gradually decreasing.

The origin of the term "REST" comes from the famous thesis from Roy Fielding describing
the concept of Representative State Transfer (REST). REST is much simpler than SOAP.
REST does not contain messaging layers or additional protocols and standards. Instead, it
focuses on using the standard four HTTP operations for creating stateless services. An
application can simply access the resource using the unique URI and a representation of the
resource. With each new resource representation, the client is said to transfer state. The
emergence of the RESTful style of web services was a reaction to the over demanding
SOAP-based standards. In RESTful web services, the emphasis is on simple point-to-point
communication over HTTP using plain old XML.

## RESTful Architectural Style
As noticed, REST is a simple way of sending and receiving data between client and server
and it doesn't have very many standards defined. You can send and receive data as XML or
even JSON or plain text. It is light weighted compared to SOAP.
Critics of non-RESTful web services often complain that they are too complex and based
upon large software vendors or integrators, rather than typical open source implementations.
This, however, has changed since WSDL 2.0 defines a full complement of non-SOAP
bindings (all the HTTP methods, not just GET and POST) and the emergence of WADL as
an alternative to WSDL. The W3C also recognises REST as one of the major classes of web
services and states that the primary purpose of REST-compliant Web services is to
manipulate XML representations of Web resources using a uniform set of "stateless"
operations.
While accessing RESTful resources with HTTP protocol, the URL of the resource serves as
the resource identifier and GET, PUT, DELETE, POST and HEAD are the standard HTTP
operations to be performed on that resource.


Rest - Representational state transfer
REST is an architectural style that can be summed up as four verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and
DELETE from HTTP 1.1) and the nouns, which are the resources available on the network
(referenced in the URI). The verbs have the following operational equivalents:

```
HTTP CRUD Equivalent
==============================
GET read
POST create,update,delete
PUT create,update
DELETE delete
```



A service to get the details of a user called 'dsmith', for example, would be handled using an HTTP
GET to http://example.org/users/dsmith. Deleting the user would use an HTTP DELETE, and creating
a new one would mostly likely be done with a POST. The need to reference other resources would
be handled using hyperlinks and separate HTTP request-responses.

## SOAP (XML) vs REST (JSON)

Both of these calls are equivalent. The SOAP version sends a lot more data in both the request
and response. Clearly, REST is a simpler way of sending and receiving data between client and
server and it doesn't have very many standards defined. You can send and receive data as JSON,
XML or even plain text. It is light weighted compared to SOAP. REST typically uses normal HTTP
methods instead of a big XML format describing everything. For example to obtain a resource
you use HTTP GET, to put a resource on the server you use HTTP PUT. To delete a resource on
the server you use HTTP DELETE. REST typically is best used with Resource Oriented Architecture
(ROA). In this mode of thinking everything is a resource, and you would operate on these
resources. As long as your programming language has an HTTP library, and most do, you can
consume a REST HTTP protocol very easily.
