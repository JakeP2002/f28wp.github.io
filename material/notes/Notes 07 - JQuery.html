# JavaScript Libraries and jQuery

## Motivation and advantages of using JavaScript Libraries

jQuery is a cross-browser Open Source JavaScript library that helps web developers to save
time and create robust code when writing JavaScript. jQuery simplifies HTML document
traversing, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions for rapid development of
interactive websites. jQuery was created by John Resig in 2005 in an attempt to simplify the
management of cross-browser issues.

Mastering HTML and CSS is not enough to transform inspiring design ideas into gorgeous
websites that enthral visitors. JavaScript is how you add complex behaviours, sophisticated
interactions, and extra excitement to your web pages. However, writing JavaScript each time
you create a new site can take a lot of effort and time. The advisable path is using suitable
JavaScript libraries, created by JavaScript experts. Among those libraries, “just using
jQuery” generally is the best option. Designers and developers over the world are using CSS
and jQuery to elegantly and rapidly implement their interaction ideas. jQuery makes it easy
client-side scripting. In fact, it makes it so easy that it’s downright good, nerdy fun. In addition
jQuery offers complete cross-browser compatibility. Anyone who has written serious
JavaScript in the past can attest that cross-browser inconsistencies will drive you mad.
jQuery works around the caveats of cross-browser issues for you. Most of the code you write
with jQuery will run exactly the same on all the major browsers, including Internet Explorer 6.
Leaving the task of hunting down obscure browser bugs to the jQuery Team allows you
more time to concentrate in implementing your ideas. Using the jQuery supports utility, you
can test to see if a certain feature is available to the user, and easily build applications that
degrade gracefully on older browsers. jQuery also supports all the CSS versions, including
the CSS3 selector specification. Selecting elements you want to change lies at the heart of
jQuery’s power. An additional advantage is that jQuery includes an assortment of utility
functions that implementing common functions with JavaScript becomes trivial: string
trimming, extending objects, chaining methods, etc. These functions by themselves are
particularly handy, but they help promote a seamless integration between jQuery and
JavaScript that results in code that’s easier to write and maintain.




Thanks to its ability to easily hook elements on the page and attach code to them in a natural
CSS-like manner, jQuery enables the implementation of best practice of separation of page
presentation from functionality. This separation of concerns leads to leaner, cleaner, and
maintainable code. jQuery isn’t limited to meddling with a page’s existing HTML; it can also
add new page elements and document fragments via a collection of useful functions. There
are functions to insert, append, and prepend new chunks of HTML anywhere on the page.
You can even replace, remove, or clone existing elements: all functions that help you to
progressively enhance your sites, thus providing a fully featured experience to users whose
browsers allow it, and an acceptable experience to everyone else. jQuery is known by its
“Graceful Scripting”, because it gracefully will fail when it can't find anything to run against. In
this sense, it works just like CSS - write your queries to match what you want, doesn't break
when nothing is found.




Last but not least is its widespread adoption. The last year alone has witnessed jQuery’s
exponential rise to prominence. 67% of the top 10,000 websites, including Google, Microsoft,
Amazon, BMW, IBM and Intel are using jQuery (source: BuiltWith’s graphs). This is good for
jQuery, as popularity equates to more active code development and plenty of interesting
third-party plug-ins. jQuery’s popularity has also spawned a large and generous community
that’s surprisingly helpful. No matter what your level of skill is, you’ll find plenty tutorials, blog
posts, and documentation as well as developers patient enough to help you out and work
through any issues you have. jQuery is the beauty of Open Source in full.


In spite of its power, jQuery is lightweight. Its core size can be less than 40Kb, less than the
average JPG image size. You can add any extras and plug-ins in a modular fashion, only
adding what you need. Moreover, every new release of jQuery is faster than the previous
one. In summary, when it comes to competing JavaScript libraries, today jQuery is the best
at manipulating the DOM, adding effects, and making Ajax requests. Still, many of the
libraries are of excellent quality and it’s always worth looking at the alternatives, but in
general you will find that jQuery is the way to go by now.




# jQuery Essentials


## Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
There are a couple of ways to use jQuery on your web site. You can download the jQuery
library from jQuery.com or you can just include jQuery from a CDN (Content Delivery
Network), like Google or Microsoft. If you decide to download jQuery, you can choose from
the Production version (it has been minified and compressed) and the Development version
(this is an uncompressed and readable code for testing and development.)

The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML `<script>` tag
(normally the `<script>` tag should be inside the `<head>` section, but see the lecture slides for
further discussion). Example of using a local copy of jQuery:

```
<head>
<script src="jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

Example of using the Google CDN option (advisable for the reasons discussed in class):

```
<head>
<script
src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js">
</script>
</head>
```


## How jQuery works

In order to traverse and manipulate the page we must wait until the page has uploaded on
the browser and it's ready to be used. jQuery has a ready event that fires the instant the 
DOM is ready to be worked with. You should normally put all your jQuery code in a ready
block, so it can be executed after the DOM has loaded unobtrusively.

```
$(document).ready(function(){
 // Your jQuery code goes in here
});
```



jQuery works in a very natural way. You find some elements and then do something with
then. You can change the style of those elements (e.g. addClass), manipulate their content
(e.g. clone, append, remove), handle events (e.g. hover, toggle), produce effects (e.g. hide,
slideDown, fadeout) or do ajax calls (e.g. load, get, post). Example:

`$("div").addClass("special");`

where:

- `$ is the jQuery Object (also named jQuery)`
- `"div" identifies all the div elements found in the page`
- `$("div") returns a jQuery set (containing 0 to many div elements).`
- `addClass(...) adds the class special to all the div elements`




## jQuery Selectors

jQuery selectors are used to “select” HTML elements using their name, id, class, types,
attributes, and other conditions implemented by jQuery. The jQuery selectors are based on
the standard W3C CSS Selectors. In addition jQuery has its own custom selectors that make
developing ever easier (e.g. :first, :last, :has(), :visible, :hidden).
The capabilities offered by the CSS selectors are complemented with a full suite of methods
for walking the DOM tree, such as:

```
.parent(), .next(), .prev(), .children(), .siblings() 
```

In jQuery, walking the DOM tree or HTML document with those method is known as
traversing. For example:

```
$("button").parent().css("border", "3px solid red");
```

jQuery provides four ways to operate with child and sibling selectors: descendant selector
(A B), child selector (A > B), adjacent sibling selector (A + B) and general sibling selector (A
~ B). A and B are selectors. Descendant selector is used to select all elements matched by
B that are child, grandchild, great-grandchild, great-great-grandchild, etc. of A. Child selector
is used to select all elements matched by B that are child of A. Adjacent sibling selector is
used to select the immediately following next element matched by B that is a sibling of A.
General sibling selector is used to select all the elements siblings of A matched by B.

# jQuery - Events

Event handling with jQuery
We have the ability to create dynamic web pages by using events. Events are actions that
can be detected by the web application. Following are examples of HTML events:

- A mouse click
- A web page loading
- Taking mouse over an element
- Submitting an HTML form
- An image is loaded
- An input field is changed
- etc.

When these events are triggered we can execute a JavaScript function to do something with
the event. These custom functions are called Event Handlers. jQuery provides the on()
method to attach an event handler to one or more events. off() removes an event handler.

```
.on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler(eventObject) )
```

where:

- `events`: One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, such as
"click"
- `selector`: A selector string to identify the selected elements that trigger the event.
- `data`: Data to be passed to the handler in event.data (a jQuery object) when an event is
triggered.
- `handler(eventObject)`: A function to execute when the event is triggered. The value false
is also allowed as shorthand for a function that simply does return false.

For example the following code will cause the division element to respond to the click event;
thus, when a user clicks inside this division, the alert will be shown:

```
$('div').on('click', function( event ){
 alert('Hi there!');
});
```

jQuery uses shorthand event types that referencing to the on() method. Each of these
shorthand event types correspond to a native DOM event:
```
.click() .keydown() .keypress()
.keyup() .mouseover() .mouseout()
.mouseenter() .mouseleave() .scroll()
.focus() .blur() .resize()
```


The shorthand event types also are associated with corresponding shorthand methods. For
example “click” is associated with click(). You can use the shorthand methods, but internally,
all of the shorthand methods make use of jQuery's on() method. Example:

```
$('button').click(function())
```

Is the same than 

```
$('button').on('click', function())
```

When you use the on() method, you pass the native event name as the first argument, and
then the handler function as the second argument. It is advisable to use the on() method
because it gives more flexibility and executes slightly faster. 

Once you have bound an event, you can unbind the event using the off() method. This will
remove any event handlers that were bound to the specified event: 

```
$('button').off( 'click');
```

One advantage that on() offers is the ability to bind and unbind specific events. For
example:
```
$('li').on( 'click.logging', function() {
 console.log( 'a list item was clicked' );
});
$('li').on( 'click.analytics', function() {
 registerClick();
});
$('li').off( 'click.logging' );
```


This code leaves the analytics-related click untouched, while unbinding the loggingrelated click.
Another benefit of using on() is the ability to bind to multiple events at once. For example,
you might want to run the same code when a user hover the mouse or when the mouse is
clicked:
```
$( 'button').on('hover click', function() {
 console.log( 'The user hovered or clicked the mouse');
});
```


## Further Optional Reading

Event bubbling: "bubbling up" means that an event applied to a child element will
propagate to its parent, grandparent and up to the top of the HTML document. jQuery
provides event.stopPropagation() to stop the bubbling up of events. Some DOM events do
not propagate – focus, blur, load, and unload don’t. 
event.stopPropagation() basically tells jQuery: only apply this event to this child node and
don't tell the parent containers anything because I don't want them to react.

Event Delegation: Event delegation is an event handling technique where, instead of
attaching event handlers directly to every element you want to listen to events on, you attach
a single event handler to a parent element of those elements to listen for events occurring on
its descendant elements. When handling the event, you check which element fired the event,
and respond accordingly. Event delegation relies on event bubbling in the DOM. Event
delegation uses less memory because you replace multiple event handlers with a single
event handler.

Manipulating content on the DOM
JQuery provides methods to manipulate DOM in efficient way making easier to modify the
value of any element's attribute or to extract HTML code from a paragraph or division. What
is important is to understand the concept used by jQuery to identify the elements of the DOM
tree. Taking into account their position/ hierarchy in the tree, elements can be grand-parents,
parents, children, descendants, ancestors and siblings.
jQuery provides both (1) methods to "traverse" — or move through — the HTML elements,
and, (2) methods to alter the value or content of the selected elements.



# DOM Manipulation Methods:
Following table lists down all the methods which you can use to manipulate DOM elements:



| Method |  Description |
|:--     |:--  |
|after( content ) | Inserts content after the selected elements| 
|append( content ) | Inserts content at the end of the selected elements.| 
|appendTo( selector ) | Append all of the matched elements to another, specified, set of elements.| 
|before( content ) | Inserts content before the selected elements| 
|clone( bool ) | Clone matched DOM Elements, and all their event handlers, and| 
|select the clones.| 
|clone( ) | Clone matched DOM Elements and select the clones.| 
|empty( ) | Removes the child elements from the selected element| 
|html( val ) | Set the html contents of every matched element.| 
|html( ) | Get the html contents (innerHTML) | of the first matched element.| 
|insertAfter( selector ) | Insert all of the matched elements after another, specified, set of elements.| 
|insertBefore( selector ) | Insert all of the matched elements before another, specified, set of elements.| 
|prepend( content ) | Inserts content at the beginning of the selected elements| 
|prependTo( selector ) | Prepend all of the matched elements to another, specified, set of elements.| 
|remove( expr ) | Removes the selected element (and its child elements)| 
|replaceAll( selector ) | Replaces the elements matched by the specified selector with the| 
|matched elements.| 
|replaceWith( content ) | Replaces all matched elements with the specified HTML or DOM elements.| 
|text( val ) | Set the text contents of all matched elements.| 
|text( ) | Get the combined text contents of all matched elements.| 
|wrap( elem ) | Wrap each matched element with the specified element.| 
|wrap( html ) | Wrap each matched element with the specified HTML content.| 
|wrapAll( elem ) | Wrap all the elements in the matched set into a single wrapper element.| 
|wrapAll( html ) | Wrap all the elements in the matched set into a single wrapper element.| 
|wrapInner( elem ) | Wrap the inner child contents of each matched element (including text nodes) | with a DOM element. wrapInner( html ) | Wrap the inner child contents of each matched element (including text nodes) with an HTML structure.



# Adding simple effects

jQuery makes it trivial to add simple effects to your page. Effects can use the built-in settings
provided by jQuery:
- .show() Show the selected elements.
- .hide() Hide the selected elements.
- .fadeIn() Animate the opacity of the selected elements to 100%.
- .fadeOut() Animate the opacity of the selected elements to 0%.
- .slideDown() Display the selected elements with a vertical sliding motion.
- .slideUp() Hide the selected elements with a vertical sliding motion.
- .slideToggle() Show or hide the selected elements with a vertical sliding motion,
depending on whether the elements are currently visible.
Please refer to the slides for this lecture for an example of using jQuery to manipulate the
DOM by adding simple effects to the DOM and, creating and appending content.


# jQuery UI
